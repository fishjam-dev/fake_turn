# Fake TURN

**This package works only with [membrane_ice_plugin](https://github.com/jellyfish-dev/membrane_ice_plugin) and it's very unlikely that you need to use it directly.**

Forked from https://github.com/processone/stun.

TURN serving as an endpoint to Membrane RTC Engine. See [How we made Membrane SFU less ICE-y](https://medium.com/membraneframework/how-we-made-membrane-sfu-less-ice-y-9625472ec386) for more information.
